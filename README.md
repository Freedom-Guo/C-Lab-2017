### 1.2.3 

- Write a program, input the character c, if c is an uppercase letter, convert c to the corresponding lowercase, otherwise the value of c remains unchanged, and finally output c

### 1.2.4

- Write a program, input unsigned short integers x, m, n (0 ≤ m ≤ 15, 1 ≤ n ≤ 16-m), and take out the n bits of x from the m-th bit to the left (m is numbered from right to left as 0～15), and make it align to the left end (15th)

### 1.2.5

- The IP address is usually 4 small integers separated by periods, such as 32.55.1.102. These addresses are represented by unsigned long integers in the machine. Write a program to read in a 32-bit Internet IP address in the form of machine storage, decode it, and then output it in the form of 4 parts separated by common periods.

### 2.2.3

- Suppose the salary tax is calculated according to the following method: x<1000, no tax; 1000<=x<2000, 5% tax; 2000<=x<3000, 10% tax; 3000<=x<4000, 15% tax is charged; 4000<=x<5000, 20% tax is charged; x>5000, 25% tax is charged. Write a program to input the amount of salary and output the amount of tax that should be collected. It is required to use if statement and switch statement to achieve.
